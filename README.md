# Java_project_chat_application
Project Description : This project is a basic Java socket-based chat application that enables real-time text communication between a server and multiple clients. It uses simple Swing UI and TCP networking to send and receive messages. The system demonstrates core networking concepts, multithreading, and efficient message handling in an easy-to-understand structure


KEY FEACTURES ---> 


1. Real-time Messaging Using TCP Sockets

The application uses Java TCP sockets to create a continuous connection between clients and the server, enabling messages to be sent and received instantly. This ensures smooth and fast communication, similar to basic chat systems.

2. Simple and Clean Swing-based User Interface

The UI is created using Java Swing components like JFrame, JTextArea, and JTextField. It is minimal, easy to navigate, and focuses entirely on sending and receiving messages without unnecessary complexity.

3. Multithreaded Server for Multiple Clients

The server uses multithreading, where each connected client is handled by a dedicated thread. This allows the server to manage multiple clients simultaneously without any delays or message overlaps.

4. Broadcast Messaging System

When any client sends a message, the server broadcasts it to all other connected clients. This creates a group chat environment where every participant receives all messages in real time.

5. Lightweight and Easy Architecture

The project does not require heavy frameworks, databases, or installations. It is purely Java-based, making it extremely lightweight and easy to run on any system with JDK installed.

6. Very Simple Setup & Execution

Running the application requires only starting the server and then launching clients. There is no additional configuration, making it perfect for beginners learning networking and Java.

7. Stable & Persistent Client–Server Connection

Once connected, each client maintains an active socket connection to the server. This ensures stable message transfer until the user manually closes the application.

8. Clear Console Logs for Debugging

Both server and clients print useful logs (like connection established, message received, client disconnected). These logs help in understanding the application's internal flow and debugging issues easily.

9. Modular Code Structure

The server, client UI, and message-handling logic are separated into different classes. This makes the project well-organized, readable, and ready for future enhancements or modifications.
